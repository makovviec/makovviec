- 👋 Hi, I’m @makovviec, but my real name is Radek and i come from Poland.

- 👀 I’m interested in Project Scheduling, this is how i earn my money for life. But in early years of 2000 i was very passionate about PHP programming. My last serious Project was supported by PHP 4.0 and MySQL database. - everyting created in notepad (oldschool stuff ;))

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Symfony and OOP. This makes a lot of fun. To increase possibilites I had to leave Windows and started learn Linux. This is very addictive and somethimes i spend too much time in front of computer.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Symfony projects... not now yet, somewhere near in the future. My goal ist to start working on it in 2022. In the moment buissnes makes me very busy and when it will change I'd like to use opportunity to go much deeper in real projects. But not as totaly noob or junior, my goal is at least mid-level, before i start to cooperate with someone. I want also deliver solutions not only unsolved problems. :)

- 📫 How to reach me ... i don't think this is the moment to contact me.
